#The FROM Instruction
The FROM instruction must always be the first instruction in the Dockerfile. As an argument, you provide a name and an optional tag for an image that should be used as the base for your Docker container. You wouldn't want to build a host OS for your app from scratch, so the FROM instruction lets you simply use an image for Linux or another OS as your basis.
